   The logic is that we're looking for values such that
     a1*x + b1 = a2*y + b2
   Solving for y:
     a2*y = (b1 - b2) + a1*x
   Take the mod of a1 on both sides:
     (a2*y) mod a1 = (b1 - b2) mod a1   (using (a1*x) mod a1 = 0)
   So then we can say:
     y = ((b1 - b2) / a2) mod a1
   The first value that represents a match between the two equations is:
     m = (a2 * y + b2)
   Because a1 and a2 are relatively prime, this match will recur with a
   frequency of a1*a2.
